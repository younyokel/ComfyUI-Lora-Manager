  Enables both flexible/dynamic input types (like for Any Switch) or a dynamic number of inputs
  (like for Any Switch, Context Switch, Context Merge, Power Lora Loader, etc).

  Note, for ComfyUI, all that's needed is the `__contains__` override below, which tells ComfyUI
  that our node will handle the input, regardless of what it is.

  However, with https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/2666 a large change would occur
  requiring more details on the input itself. There, we need to return a list/tuple where the first
  item is the type. This can be a real type, or use the AnyType for additional flexibility.

  This should be forwards compatible unless more changes occur in the PR.
